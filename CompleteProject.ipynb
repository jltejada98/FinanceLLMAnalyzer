Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple's COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2008, the Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of 2009, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased to report the best non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings in our history. These results exceeded our expectations and we continue to be very pleased with our performance in this economy. Revenue for the quarter was $8.16 billion, representing 9% growth over the prior March quarter’s results. Operating margin percentage for the quarter was one of our highest ever at 20.4%, primarily due to higher than anticipated revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.2 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.33. In terms of non-GAAP measure, adjusted sales totaled $9.06 billion for the March quarter, which was $900 million higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was $3.62 billion, which was $650 million higher than our reported gross margin, and adjusted net income was $1.66 billion, $450 million higher than our reported net income. We continue to believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis and understanding of our performance. Turning to the details of our results, I’d like to begin with our Mac products and services. For the March quarter, we sold 2.22 million Macs compared to 2.29 million Macs in the year-ago quarter, a 3% decline. In the year-ago March quarter, Mac sales increased 51% year-over-year due in part to January 2008 launch of the MacBook Air, creating a very difficult compare. Our Mac shipments in this year’s March quarter compares favorably to the 7% year-over-year contraction in the market overall, based on the latest estimate for the quarter, published by IDC. We successfully transitioned the entire Mac desktop line in March and continue to see a strong year-over-year growth in MacBook shipments. Our overall units sell through of Macs was flat year-over-year and given the tough year-over-year comp and the challenging economic environment, we feel very positive about our Mac performance. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. We experienced strong sales with January releases of iLife ’09 and iWork ’09. We believe the outstanding features of iLife and iWork are among the very compelling reasons why customers are drawn to the Mac experience. Now, I’d like to discuss our music products and services. We sold over 11 million iPods, representing a new March quarter unit record and 3% growth over the year-ago quarter. We generated very strong year-over-year growth in sales of iPod Touch as customers continue to embrace the superior features of the platform, coupled with the rapidly growing array of applications available through the App Store. Customers and reviewers responded favorably to the March introduction of the all-new iPod Shuffle, the world’s smallest music player, featuring a great new industrial design, voice-over technology, and convenient new earphone cord controls. We remain very pleased with iPod market share. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% based on the latest monthly data, published by NPD, and we continue to gain share year-over-year in both international markets based on the latest data published by GFK. We saw healthy year-over-year iPod unit sales growth in a number of large markets including the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, Australia, and China. We began and ended the quarter within our target range of 46 weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes Store delivered another great quarter, fueled by strong sales of music, video, and apps. We recently introduced a number of changes to the iTunes Store including the availability of DRM-free iTunes Plus titles from all four major labels, as well as thousands of independent artists. The App Stores continues to be an unparallel success for developers and customers and now offers over 35,000 applications compared to the 15,000 available as of our last conference call. We are within hours of reaching our 1 billionth download, an astounding number given the number of – given the short nine-month history of the App Store. We believe the App Store is a key strategic differentiator of the iPhone and iPod Touch experience and is more evidence of what we have always said, that software is a key ingredient for a great mobile experience. We continue to believe that we are years ahead of competition and we are very excited about the prospects of even more compelling apps as developers take advantage of the many new features that will enabled by the iPhone OS 3.0 this summer. Turning to the iPhone, we were extremely pleased to have sold almost 3.8 million handsets in the March quarter, a 123% increase over the 1.7 million handsets sold in the year-ago quarter. We continue to expand iPhone’s geographic reach during the quarter and are now selling this in 81 countries. Revenue recognized from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales, and carrier payments was $1.52 billion compared to $378 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 300%. The sales value of iPhones sold during the quarter was over $2.2 billion. On March 17th, we provided developers with a preview of iPhone OS 3.0 and began the developer seeding process. The iPhone OS 3.0 release will include an updated software development kit with over a 1,000 new developer APIs, enabling in-app purchases, peer-to-peer connections, app control of accessories, and push notifications. The iPhone OS 3.0 release will also add over a 100 customer features including cut, copy, and paste, spotlight search, landscape keyboard and view for all key iPhone apps and MMS support. Developers have responded very enthusiastically to the new SDK and we expect that customers will love the many new features of iPhone OS 3.0 and the new apps that will be available. Because we announced these specific new features and plan to provide iPhone customers to them as a free upgrade, we have delayed the start of revenue recognition for all iPhones sold on or after March 17th announcement date until the iPhone OS 3.0 software is released this summer. The revenue and cost of sales associated with these iPhones will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of respective 24-month estimated lives. Revenue recognition for handset sales prior to March 17th is not affected by the announcement. I’d now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. The stores recognized $1.47 billion of revenue during the March quarter compared to $1.45 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our stores sold 438,000 Macs, about half of which were to customers who have never owned a Mac before. We opened one new store during the quarter, bringing us to 252 stores. With an average of 251 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5.9 million compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin was $308 million compared to $334 million in the year-ago quarter. We believe that the year-over-year decline in average store sales and segment margin is a reflection of the continued weakness in the spending environment, coupled with third party channel expansions relative to the year-ago quarter. We hosted 39.1 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 33.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 16%. We also hosted a record 644,000 personal training sessions during the quarter, an increase of 11% year-over-year. We remain on track to open a total of about 25 stores during fiscal 2009, about half of which we expect to be outside the U.S. Total company gross margin was 36.4%, which was 390 basis points better than our guidance. This difference was primarily driven by three factors. First, commodity and other hardware component costs were significantly lower than we planned. We have been very disciplined with our inventory management, which allowed us to take advantage of the continued favorable commodity market during the quarter. Second, sales of higher-margin products including software and accessories were better than planned. And third, we benefited from lower freight and warranty costs. Operating expenses were $1.3 billion including $152 million in stock-based compensation expense. OpEx was $26 million below our guidance as we spent less in many areas of the company. OI&E was $63 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 30.3%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $28.9 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $28.1 billion at the end of the December quarter. Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $841 million. Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital, which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high-quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio. Looking ahead to the June quarter, I’d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We will continue our process of providing guidance based on GAAP and we will report our June quarter non-GAAP financial measures during July when we release our results. Forecasting in the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging. So, we will continue to provide a range of guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be between $7.7 billion and $7.9 billion. This reflects not starting revenue recognition for iPhones sold on or after March 17th until the date of the iPhone OS 3.0 software is released. We expect gross margins to be about 33%, reflecting approximately $30 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $1.35 billion including a $150 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $55 million, reflective of the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 31%. We are targeting EPS in the range of $0.95 to $1. In closing, we are very pleased with our record March quarter results and how well Apple is performing in this economy. We are extremely enthusiastic about the launch of the iPhone OS 3.0 and can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands this summer. We are also very excited about the other products in our pipeline. We remain confident in our strategy and are working hard to deliver the world’s most innovative and extraordinary products. With that, I’d like to open the call to questions.\\nOperator: (Operator instructions) Your first question will come from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\\nRichard Gardner – Citigroup: All right. Thanks. Well, great job on the quarter and in the absence of too much else to pick on, I guess I’ll ask the standard component question of Tim, what is your outlook in terms of pricing and component supply going into the June quarter, please?\\nTim Cook: Hi, Rich. March quarter, we believed that most of the excess inventory in the supply chain was consumed. And so, where we see the component environment still being favorable on an overall basis, it will be some commodities like NAND as an example, which will increase sequentially. NAND in particular has recently increased due to reduced wafer starts from several of the suppliers attempting to address the profitability issues. Other than that, I think last quarter was about wringing out excess inventory environment we continue to be favorable, but I don’t expect to see the level of reductions that we experienced in calendar quarter one.\\nRichard Gardner – Citigroup: But you do expect Tim, the aggregate building materials to be down sequentially in the June quarter?\\nTim Cook: I expect it to be within a similar range as last quarter.\\nRichard Gardner – Citigroup: Okay. All right, thanks.\\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: That will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\\nKeith Bachman – Bank of Montreal: Hi, thanks. Peter, for you. Cash flow was actually down year-over-year. It’s the first time going back for some period of time that I’ve seen cash flow from operations to be down on the year-over-year for the March quarter. Could you talk about a little bit of what was driving that and specifically, was there anything on the deferred revenue recognition – the deferred balance that changed consistent with the revenue recognition policies or the like thereof when you went to the new software platform?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Keith, no, there is nothing with what iPhone or deferred revenue or cost from a policy change that played into that. I was actually very pleased with the cash generation in the quarter, was up over $700 million from the end of the December quarter. But there are three things to discuss with you that did play into the cash generation in the quarter. First, as we talked about in the last quarter’s call, we did make our prepayment to LGD for $500 million [ph]. Second, you’d notice that our accounts payable was down from the December to March quarter by over $700 million. The decline in AP as we leave the holiday quarter and conclude the March quarter is very typical for us. So, there is nothing new there, but that does play into the sequential results. The third component to discuss with you is our tax payments. We made about $1.3 billion in tax payments in the March quarter and there is a couple of things that were driving that. First of all, for the current fiscal year, so this year, fiscal ’09, we make our first estimated tax payments in the March quarter for the current fiscal year and in fact, there are two that are due in the quarter. This year, the tax payments were higher than what we saw last year because A, we are making more money, and B, given the equity markets, the credit that the company gets from employee option and RSU gains are down. So, we paid more tax for that and then also, we prepaid some potential audit settlements that were accrued on the balance sheet, but we paid them on a cash basis this quarter for prior years and we trued up for fiscal ’08 this quarter as well. So, all three of those things combine for $1.3 billion in tax payments this quarter and that was up significantly year-over-year.\\nKeith Bachman – Bank of Montreal: Okay. Thank you, Peter.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: You’re welcome.\\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Keith. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: This will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.\\nBen Reitzes – Barclays Capital: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about the Mac business? It seems that desktop side exceeded our expectations, obviously due to the launch, but sequentially the ASP in desktops if my math is right, looks like it was down quite a bit. Could you just talk about what’s going on in the Mac business, how the new Macs are doing, what you think of your pipeline, but also what’s going on with ASPs like – am I right that there was a mix down in the desktop area and just what’s going on in particular with regard to the mix with this tough economy in maybe notebooks and desktops?\\nTim Cook: Okay. Hi Ben, it’s Tim.\\nBen Reitzes – Barclays Capital: Hi Tim.\\nTim Cook: Across the quarter, as we got into March and announced a completely new desktop line, we saw an acceleration of sales and it was that acceleration that allowed us on a sell-through basis to approximately be equal to the year before. After we did the desktop launch, we began to ship a higher mix of desktops than we were before the transition and that helped to push the overall ASP down. Within the desktops themselves, the top end of the line, Mac Pro, we had a lower mix to the Mac Pro, a higher mix to the Mac mini than we had before the transition and really all throughout the quarter, the Pro products that are primarily being sold to the creative professionals, were weaker than they were in the year-ago quarter and we believe that that’s mainly economic related, as you would guess, businesses are cutting back on technology expenditures. In addition, education in the U.S. contracted by about 11% year-over-year and this is a result of states not having the tax revenues as projected and we are hoping that as we get into this quarter that the stimulus funds that were approved last quarter begin to flow to the states and we see some benefit from that. But that remains to be seen. So, net-net, yes, ASP did decline, it was – desktops were a piece of it, but doing all the desktops in a single day, which was – it’s unprecedented for us to do that, really helped us drive more sales in March and get the Mac business to a much better level by the end of the quarter. In the notebook business, we did have an ASP decline sequentially and that was mainly driven by a higher mix to the $999 MacBook that we had announced partway through the quarter in the October – late October timeframe. I think that’s actually a good thing, not a bad thing, because I think what you see is, for us anyway, the consumer is holding up much better than the professional, and much better than education. Education is gated by tax receipts and funding and the professional is really cutting back expenses and delaying – I don’t think it’s business we are losing necessarily, but delaying purchases.\\nBen Reitzes – Barclays Capital: It’s no secret that the netbook is obviously doing pretty well. Do you have any thoughts there on that category now that you’ve been able to watch it for a few quarters and what you are thinking and it has obviously held up the market a bit in the recent data and you don’t have it, and you still outperformed the market? Just any thoughts on where you are and where you aren’t that you might want to share?\\nTim Cook: For us, it’s about doing great products. And when I look at what is being sold in the netbook space today, I see cramped keyboards, terrible software, junky hardware, very small screens, and just not a consumer experience, and not something that we would put the Mac brand on quite frankly. And so, it’s not a space as it exists today that we are interested in, nor do we believe that customers in the long term would be interested in. It’s a segment we would choose not to play in. That said, we do look at the space and are interested to see our customers’ respond to it. People that want a small computer so to speak that does browsing and e-mail, might want to buy an iPod Touch or they might want to buy an iPhone. And so, we have other products to accomplish some of what people are buying netbooks for and so, in that particular way we play in an indirect basis. And then of course, if we find a way where we can deliver an innovative product that really makes a contribution, then we will do that and we have some interesting ideas in the space. The product pipeline is fantastic for the Mac. We are – as we look back over the last four plus years, 17 of the 18 quarters of the last four-and-a-half years, we’ve exceeded the market rate of growth. And to exceed in this horrendous economy, I think is quite an accomplishment, especially when you look at the – that these very low-priced netbooks that are – I think it’s a stretch to call it a personal computer, are really propping up the unit numbers from the industry as a whole. So, we feel great about our performance. It’s a very solid performance, especially in this environment and the pipeline looks fantastic.\\nBen Reitzes – Barclays Capital: All right, great. Well, I’ll be there in June and look forward to hearing from you. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Okay.\\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: That will come from Bill Fearnley with FTN Equity Capital.\\nBill Fearnley – FTN Equity Capital: Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Could I ask a question here on the App Store? Is there any additional color you can give even directionally on the mix between paid and free downloads on the App Store overall, any additional color between the iPhone and the iPod Touch, and then I had a quick follow-up, if I could?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: I’m sorry. We don’t disclose the free versus the paid, but we are just hours away from our billionth download and couldn’t be happier with the Store’s results.\\nTim Cook: Bill, this is Tim. I would add to that a couple of things. One, one of the keys behind the growth of the iPod this quarter despite the economic environment was that the iPod Touch more than doubled year-over-year. So, it was a tremendous result and as Peter mentioned earlier in his remarks, the sum of iPhone plus iPod Touch is now about 37 million units and so, it provides an enormous platform for developers to develop on and with the – with our recent SDK changes the developers are working on now, I think it just unleashes a whole new level of innovation that keeps Apple years ahead of everyone else.\\nBill Fearnley – FTN Equity Capital: Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks. And then, could you guys provide the direct/indirect sales mix for the quarter and did it have an effect on gross margins for the quarters and does it have any bearing on your guidance here for the third quarter? Thanks.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, the direct percent in the March quarter was 48%. It really didn’t have a bearing on gross margin that was reasonably close to what we thought. Now, as we enter the June quarter, the education buying season begins and that is one of the reasons why I expect gross margin to be down sequentially along with the impact of the U.S. dollar and the commodity and component environment.\\nBill Fearnley – FTN Equity Capital: Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you.\\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Bill. Could we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: From Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Bill Shope\\nBill Shope – Credit Suisse: Okay thanks guys. Given your gross margin performance over the past several quarters as well as the guidance, how should we think about the long-term 30% gross margin target that you’ve mentioned in the past. It seems that just looking at the product mix, particularly on a GAAP basis is mathematically very difficult to get there without some fairly drastic changes to the business model. How do you guys think about that longer-term?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well I have given you our guidance for the June quarter at about 33%. For the September quarter, I think our gross margins would be about 30%. We – I’m not going to make comments on fiscal ‘10. I think the important part is as you look forward, it’s just to understand that we are very, very focused on delivering extraordinary products to our customers and we’re going to provide them ever increasing value and we just don’t want you to count on the gross margins that you’ve recently seen which have benefited from just a tremendous commodity and component environment.\\nBill Shope – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then you sort of mentioned this when you talked about consumer versus professional and education, but would you say that you’re seeing any signs of stabilization in the consumer market that some of the other tech companies decided in recent weeks and with that in mind, can you comment on the linearity of the quarter and what you sort of saw on a trend line basis as you progressed through the quarter.\\nTim Cook: Yes, Bill, we’re not – we are not economist and so we are not entering the game of predicting bottoms and that sort of thing. We will report our results and give a view of the next quarter. But if you look at the different product areas, which is the way that we think about it, if you looked at the iPod linearity through the quarter and you overlaid last year, you would see very little difference in the two curves. We were up 3% year-over-year, and so very, very similar and not much to mention except for the point I made earlier that from a mix point of view, the iPod Touch is the runaway hit and it’s clearly being driven by the App Store that we spoke about earlier. On the Mac side, as I mentioned earlier, our sells, our unit sell through had accelerated in March after we turned every desktop in the company on the same day. And so March is a very important month for the Mac business. When you look at the iPhones, the iPhones linearity to the quarter, it was reasonably linear business after the first week or two; it was very little up and down in the aggregate. Obviously it’s a new business for us, it’s the first March quarter that we’ve had rolled out to significant number of countries and so we were exceptionally pleased to see that instead of the normal seasonality curve that one would associate with most consumer electronics.\\nBill Shope – Credit Suisse: Okay, very helpful. Thanks.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes.\\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Bill. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: And it will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\\nGene Munster – Piper Jaffray: Hi good afternoon. Congratulations. I’ve got a question on the iPod. Our survey board suggest the exclusive relationship with the AT&T is the number one reason why people don’t purchase an iPhone and given the revenue shares no longer exist, can you walk us through some of your thinking in terms of why maintain an exclusive with AT&T. Just a follow-up question regarding any update on Steve Jobs? Thanks.\\nTim Cook: On AT&T, Gene, we view AT&T as a very good partner. We believe that they’re the best wireless provider in the US and we are very happy to be doing business with them. They have done a very good job with iPhone, they’ve put the full force and weight of their company behind it, it’s a major strategic thrust for them and so we’re very happy with the relationship that we have and do not have a plan to change it.\\nGene Munster – Piper Jaffray: Is there a structural reason why you need to maintain with AT&T from a technology perspective?\\nTim Cook: Well from a technology point of view as you know, Verizon is on CDMA and we’ve shown from the beginning of the iPhone to focus on one phone for the whole of the world and when you do that, you really go down the GSM root, because CDMA is – doesn’t really have a life to it after a point in time.\\nGene Munster – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then I guess one more before the Steve Jobs question is any color on kind of the hole up as far as getting China up and rolling on the iPhone?\\nTim Cook: On – okay, let me just comment on BRIC in general. We now have of the four BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, we have three of those up and we have 8,000 store counts in those three selling the iPhones and we feel very good about that and we’re putting a lot of energy in growing those. China, we are not in yet. We would like to be in China within the next year and are currently working on that. But I have got nothing specific to announce today on this.\\nGene Munster – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And on Steve Jobs? I will let Peter make a comment there.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, what is your question?\\nGene Munster – Piper Jaffray: Any update regarding Steve Jobs and his return?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: We will look forward to Steve returning at the Apple at the end of June.\\nGene Munster – Piper Jaffray: Great, thank you.\\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Gene. Could we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: We will hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\\nToni Sacconaghi – Sanford Bernstein: Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit Mac question. Your Mac business was down 8% in the Americas, I presume that the US was potentially worst than that. According to Gartner, the US market was flat this quarter. Though you actually did lose material share and I think as you noted despite the fact that you had a new desktop line up that created a surge in your run rate at the end of the quarter. So I guess given that statement, one, do you care about your market share in the US? And second, given the movement in ASPs that you saw towards the lower end and given your share performance in the US, does that shape or change your thinking about Mac pricing in anyway?\\nTim Cook: On – Toni, it’s Tim. On a worldwide basis, just to make sure we’re in sync with the numbers, IDC projected a – that the market contracted by 7% worldwide. On a reported basis, we contracted by 3%, but as Peter said in his opening comments on a sell-through basis, we were essentially flat year-over-year. In the US, the US was our weakest, largest geography in terms of comparison year-over-year. But I would remind you that in our US business, a larger percentage of that business is education oriented and therefore subject to the budget constraints that have been significant in many, many other states, actually almost of the states. And so I think that’s one reason why the US is disproportionately affected. And the second is that we saw a less pro Macintoshes being bought in the US on a relative basis to other geographies and we would attribute that also to the economy. There were some mix found there across the world that’s much more so in the US where I think the professional markets have been hit much harder. And so do I care about US share, of course, I do. However, I think cycles come and cycles go. And what we’re about is making the best computers in the world, not making the most, and not getting to a point where we are building products that we are not building products that we are not proud of. And so that first and foremost is our objective and we believe that if we do that over the long-term that we will gain share. We’re – I am not going to worry about the ebb and flow of each 90 days, because I think that leads you to make a lot of short-term decisions that are not good for the company or for the brand over time.\\nToni Sacconaghi – Sanford Bernstein: Tim, could you also comment on your thinking about expanding iPhone adoption. Recently when – you have said that one area where you are spending a lot of time is thinking about how to increase the adoption of the iPhone and you have been thinking a lot about elasticity. One comment that it struck me was that you were surprised by from your research at the elasticity that you thought was associated with the price of the device. Can you update me on your thinking or what you have learned about iPhone elasticity, now a quarter or later?\\nTim Cook: Well, yes, we had a very good quarter in the March quarter. With actually a very small sequential declines for holiday quarter which was far above what our expectations were, so we’re very pleased with how we did. We also announced 3.0 or previewed it developers so that they could begin to change their apps, introduce more apps for the phone, which we believe increases the ecosystem and increases the number of people that want and will buy phone it’s even more. And so we’re very focused on the products side. We’re very focused on the App Store. There we are also focused on geographic rollouts. We spent time this quarter on the Middle East and Asia and rolled up Saudi Arabia, UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand to name a few and we’re obviously focused on more in the future. And so between those the product plans that we’ve got in the App Store and the software that you have seen and then things I can’t talk about, we have a plan that we believe continues to make us the leader in the space, continues to keep us years ahead of others and one of the things that we will make sure is that we don’t leave a price umbrella for people.\\nToni Sacconaghi – Sanford Bernstein: And then finally I guess one for Peter, quickly in response to one of the other questions, you talked about considerations for margins in terms of forces that work to the degree that you can – can you help give us a bridge in terms of your thinking whether it’s qualitatively or quantitatively about how we think about 36.4% gross margins this quarter to 33% next quarter, can you rank order the forces, can you explain and then rank order the forces in terms of their impact on that expected deceleration?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes on the – and I will say the larger two out of three are the stronger US dollar and seasonally lower mix driven largely by the beginning the education buying season. Let me talk about each of those. Regarding the dollar, the dollar is all but stronger today than where it was throughout most of the March quarter. But the – the bigger impact for us on a sequential basis regarding the dollar is our hedges. In our December and March quarter, we had the hedges in place that we’re put in place at the time that the dollar was not as strong and the hedges that we have in place for the June quarter largely we will put in place during March at stronger dollar levels and that’s really what is the – is really the driving factor behind the sequential impact of the dollar. And of course the ed buying season begins in the June quarter and June tends to be more dominated by K-12s than High Eds. The September quarter historically is stronger for High Eds than for K-12. And K-12 being more of an institutional sale and we expect to be competitive this year especially given the funding situation that tend to strike.\\nToni Sacconaghi – Sanford Bernstein: Thank you.\\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Toni. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Next comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.\\nDavid Bailey – Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you very much. I was wondering if you have any information on the percentage of customers that upgraded their iTunes music library now that you’ve launched the DRM free feature. And if you can give us some idea what the revenue from that might have been.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Dave, it’s just been a couple of weeks. So I think it’s – I think it’s sort of too soon to tell in and I don’t have anything sort of specific on that. The March quarter was very strong for us on the iTunes Store. We saw very, very strong growth in music, video, and of course applications.\\nDavid Bailey – Goldman Sachs: And then did you say for the September quarter, the margins and gross margin might go down to around 30%, I was just wondering what the reasons you thought it might drop off again would be?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well I am not giving guidance for the September quarter at this point. But in answer to Bill’s question, I said about 34 for the September quarter. We’ll – we’ll give you more of our thoughts in July on the September quarter.\\nDavid Bailey – Goldman Sachs:\\n :\\nNancy Paxton: Thanks David. Could we have the next question please?\\nOperator: The next is Scott Craig with Banc of America.\\nScott Craig – Banc of America: Thanks, good afternoon. Just with regards to cash flow Peter, is there anything in the June quarter that you guys would consider sort of one-timish items that could impact like we saw this quarter? And then I have a follow up.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Let me just kind of quickly go back through what occurred this quarter. So from March to the June quarter, I would not expect the holiday phenomena that we see each year of going from the holiday quarter to the March quarter and necessarily the impact on accounts payable. I don’t have any preface to announce that we’re going to make in the June quarter, so we did make a $500 million repayment in March. And then related to the tax payments, we will make an estimated payment for fiscal ’09 in the June quarter and then we will make one in the September quarter as well. But I don’t expect to have any of the prior year audit true-ups or to make any more payments on fiscal ’08, so I don’t expect the tax payments to have the significance in the June quarter that they did in the March quarter.\\nScott Craig – Banc of America: Okay. And then just a follow up on the iPhone for Tim, perhaps, you guys started with Wal-Mart I think towards the end of December last quarter and your sales came in probably higher than most people thought. How much of an impact was Wal-Mart there and then what was the channel inventory in the iPhone as you exited the quarter? That’s it from me. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: In terms of Wal-Mart, and as you probably know, they’re a very key partner for us, relative to iPod and we did expand through them for iPhone coverage and we believe they do provide us extended reach in areas that we weren’t heading before. And we’re pleased with the results there thus far, but it’s in the early going and so there is not much to report there yet. In terms of total distribution across the world, we are selling iPhone now in over 50,000 storefronts in the 81 countries, so we have a sizeable presence and sizeable channel in the space. In terms of channel inventory, if you remember last time – last quarter, I told you that or implied that we had about 1.75 million units in inventory and to remind you in case you guys have forgotten, we are very conservative as to how we count inventory. For example, we count demos that aren’t sellable in inventory and we have about 100,000 of these 50,000 locations. We count units that are in transit from our factories to the carriers that are not physically available for sale and at the end of a quarter, at the end of the last quarter in particular that was around 100,000 units. So just to put your perspective – to put some context and perspective on now, we also in many cases count inventory all the way to the storefront. I think there are many people in the industry that that count units as sell through and seize to count channel inventory beyond the distribution center, it’s just not the way we look at it. We like to be very disciplined in this environment. So on your specific question, I’m not going to talk about weeks, because we don’t frankly have the experience headed into this quarter about the seasonality given this will be our first June quarter with a – with a sort of a worldwide spread. But we sold the channel inventory in the countries that we were in at the beginning of the December quarter fall by the end of the quarter. But with the countries that we added which I mentioned before, we added a net of around 80,000 units and so we ended at 1.83 million units. And again that includes all of those categories that I had mentioned earlier. Net-net, we’re very comfortable with the inventory and we have people running more of it.\\nScott Craig – Banc of America: Okay thank you.\\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Scott. Could we have the next question please?\\nOperator: We will hear from Charles Wolf with Needham.\\nCharles Wolf – Needham: Yes. In view of the explosion in the number of applications for the iPhone and the iTouch, I was wondering what steps Apple is taking to ensure that the iPhone Apps can be discovered? And are these any different from music discovery on the iTunes Store?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Charlie, we are doing a number of things. We include easy to find top 50 and 100 Apps, both paid for and free. We’ve got them associated in various genres as well and we’re expanding those. And so I think the team has done a fantastic job making Apps easy to discover and fun to discover.\\nCharles Wolf – Needham: Are there any kind of unusual patterns in application sales by title versus music sales by title?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Charlie, I would have to say that hitting a billion downloads in about 9 months is every exciting. I think customers are having a lot of fun. I think all of the genres are pretty popular. But of course games and you can see those by the top apps list are a quite popular. And I think that’s one of the reasons why the iPod Touch is an example who has been such a success.\\nCharles Wolf – Needham: Okay. Thanks a lot.\\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Charlie. Could we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: From Cross Research, you will hear from Shannon Cross.\\nShannon Cross – Cross Research: Thank you, good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing in terms of the competitive landscape for smartphones especially as we move closer to the launches of Palm Tree and as well as obviously the iPhone 3.0? And then I have a follow up.\\nTim Cook: I think it is difficult to comment on products that aren’t shipping and so I – there is nothing intelligent I could say on the pre. The iPhone has now sold over 21 million and has the highest overall customer satisfaction of the new order shipping. And so we think that we are in a great position and with the combination of the App Store and affiliates download that should occur tomorrow, we think that we are years ahead. We very much look at this business or see it through the software platform lens and I think that has – that has benefited us and our customers very well. The breadth of Apps on the store mind boggling from everything from fun things as games to very serious medical kind of applications. And so the power of the device and the ecosystem is enormous and I think we are just scratching the surface now on its opportunity.\\nShannon Cross – Cross Research: Okay, great. And then Peter, we saw your comments on the tape earlier about use of cash, but I figured I would ask the question anyway. Any thoughts on the cash balance, obviously it was not up as much this quarter, but it sounds like given some of the uses of cash. But obviously going forward, there is substantial cash generation. So any thoughts there?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well let me begin by saying for all the right reasons, we are making – we are working hard to try and be sure that your prediction of entry of cash does occur. But no, nothing new to announce to you today and we continue to be careful with how we’re investing cash and we’re very focused on principal preservations.\\nShannon Cross – Cross Research: What’s the – what’s the timing on construction of the new headquarters? Any update there?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: No, no update. Things are quite busy here. And well we will begin to focus on that in the future, but no updates today.\\nShannon Cross – Cross Research: Okay, thank you.\\nTim Cook: We’re spending all of our energy on constructing new products.\\nShannon Cross – Cross Research: That’s a good choice.\\nTim Cook: Yes.\\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Could we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: We will hear from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\\nChris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Your gross margin guidance seemed to – seems to imply that you expect an unreasonably strong education selling season at least in terms of mix. Was that in consideration and combined with the desktop refresh? Can you help us understand why you expect about a 4.5% sequential revenue decline into the June quarter at its midpoint?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. As we were putting our guidance for the June quarter together, a couple of things. First of all, last year in a much better economy, our Q3 revenue was down 1% sequentially. This year our guidance provides for a couple of more points of – of sequential decline. Now however it is important to point out that we are guiding for year-over-year growth on a GAAP basis and we would expect our adjusted sales growth to be even higher. But as we think about this year, first, the economy and its continuing impact on consumers and business and the education buying season which we begins this quarter, I discussed earlier that the June quarter is more dominated by K-12 that’s an institution sale and we expect things to be competitive this year given the economy and the funding situations. And we expect some reductions in ASP sequentially as we usually experience in the June quarter. Second, we will not begin to recording revenue on new iPhone sold since our March 17th event. And we will start that when we release the iPhone OS 3.0 software this summer. And finally, I talked a bit about in some of the gross margin discussion the currency environment and we expect the dollars to have an impact not only on gross margin, but of course on our revenue as well largely related to where we got the quarter hedged and the current spot rates.\\nChris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank: What impact is like software to have on mix in the June quarter?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: We don’t give specific product guidance. But in the March quarter, iLife and iWork sales exceeded our expectations and we’re one of the reasons why both revenue and gross margin was higher than we expected.\\nChris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Final question from me is around protecting your IP. Last quarter you talked about rigorously impacting your intellectual property. We haven’t seen any action in the past 90 days, does that say something about either number one, your position, your patent position or number two, the product actually need to ship before you can take action on the IP side? Thanks.\\nTim Cook: We think that Apple’s innovation in the iPhone as I said before is leading the industry by years. And we think competition is great, we think it makes all of us better as long as other companies invent their own stock.\\nNancy Paxton: Okay, thanks Chris.

Morgan Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC\\nOperator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\\'am.\\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Please note that some of the information you\\'ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\\'s Form 10-K for 2010, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC this afternoon along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information or speak as of their respective date. And with that, I\\'d like to turn the call over to Apple\\'s CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the outstanding results of our December quarter. The performance of our business was extremely strong, as we sold more Macs, iPhones and iPads than in any previous quarter in Apple\\'s history. And as a result, we\\'re thrilled to announce all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings.  Revenue for the quarter was $26.7 billion, an increase of more than $11 billion over the prior December quarter\\'s result, representing growth of 71%. The robust revenue growth was fueled by record iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. Operating margin was over $7.8 billion, representing 29.3% of revenue. Net income was $6 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings record set in the September quarter by $1.7 billion, and represented 78% growth over the year-ago quarter\\'s earnings. These results translated to earnings per share of $6.43.  Turning to the details of the quarter, I\\'d like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new quarterly record with sales of 4.13 million Macs, representing 23% growth over the year-ago quarter. That\\'s almost 8x IDC\\'s most recently published estimate of 3% growth for the PC market. We experienced strong sales growth in each of our geographic segments, with over 50% growth in both the Asia-Pacific region and Japan. The growth was fueled primarily by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, which was launched in October, as well as continued strong sales of MacBook Pro. Customers love the new thin and light unibody design of the MacBook Air, and the impressive responsiveness and reliability of its solid-state storage, while MacBook Pro continues to provide customers tremendous speed and high-performance graphics at an excellent value.  We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. We opened the Mac App Store in January 6, bringing what we\\'ve learned from iOS Apps to Mac users to make discovering, installing and updating apps easier than ever. The Mac App Store is available in 90 countries, and features more than 1,000 free and paid apps in categories like education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity and utility. We\\'ve been very pleased with customer response, with over 1 million downloads on the first day alone.  Moving to our music products. We sold 19.4 million iPods compared to 21 million in the year-ago quarter. We experienced continued strong sales of iPod touch, which grew 27% year-over-year and accounted for over 50% of all iPods sold during the quarter. iPod\\'s share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.  The iTunes Store generated another strong quarter with revenue exceeding $1.1 billion, thanks to strong sales of music, video and apps. We were extremely pleased to bring the legendary music of the Beatles to iTunes during the quarter and to introduce movies to the iTunes Store in Japan. And as we announced a few weeks ago, iTunes users are now renting and purchasing over 400,000 TV episodes and over 150,000 movies per day.  I\\'d now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold 16.2 million iPhones compared to 8.7 million in the previous December quarter. This represents 86% year-over-year growth compared to IDC\\'s latest published estimate of 70% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the December quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $10.47 billion during the quarter, compared to $5.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 88%.  The sales value of iPhones alone was over $10.1 billion, which yields an ASP of about $625. At the end of the December quarter, we had iPhone distributions through 185 carriers in 90 countries. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth in all of our segments, with sales in the Asia-Pacific region and Japan both more than doubling year-over-year.  Enterprise customers continue to embrace iPhone, with 88 of the Fortune 100 companies and almost 60% of the Financial Times Europe 100 companies now testing or deploying iPhones. Strong employee demand in custom app development are fueling deployment within the corporate sector.  Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device list worldwide. Most recently, Fortune 500, like Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, DuPont, Staples, Starbucks and Genworth Financial, and Global 500 accounts such as Nissan Motor, BBVA [Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria], Standard Chartered Group and Danone, have made iPhone available to their employees.  We ended the quarter with about 3.5 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 250k. We continue to have a sizable backlog, and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to supply them. And we\\'re thrilled to begin working with Verizon next month to offer iPhone 4 to its more than 93 million customers, as well as to new customers who want iPhone 4 on Verizon.  Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its momentum and customer interest. We sold 7.3 million iPads, a sequential increase of over 3 million, with distribution in 46 countries by the end of the December quarter. We continue to see great enthusiasm for iPads from consumer, business and education customers. Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment remains strong, and the response to the product continues to be significant.  Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved device list at an amazing rate. Today, over 80% of the Fortune 100 are already deploying or piloting iPad, up from 65% in the September quarter. Some recent examples include JPMorgan Chase, Cardinal Health, Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, Sears Holdings and DuPont.  Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $4.61 billion. The sales value by iPads alone was over $4.4 billion, which yields an ASP of about $600. We increased the supply of iPads during the quarter and expanded both the number of countries and the number of channel partners carrying iPad.  Channel inventory increased by about 525,000 units from the beginning to the end of the quarter to support increased sales and channel expansion, and we ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached over 160 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the December quarter.  In November, we launched iOS 4.2, which brings over 100 new features to iPad users including multitasking, folders, unified inbox, Game Center, AirPlay and AirPrint.  The App Store continues to be incredibly successful, with over 300,000 apps available and well over 9 billion downloads to date. We continue to be very pleased with iAd, which combines the narrative quality of TV ads with the interactivity of digital to provide a new kind of advertising experience. During the quarter, we expanded iAds beyond the U.S. to Europe and Japan and provided iAd Producer to marketers.  I\\'d now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had a record-breaking quarter. Retail revenue almost doubled year-over-year to $3.85 billion compared to $1.97 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 95%. iPad sales in our stores were very strong in the first holiday quarter. The stores also delivered a record Mac quarter, selling 851,000 Macs compared to 689,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 24%. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. International Retail Store sales were particularly strong with our average international store volume exceeding our very productive average U.S. store volume.  Additionally, our four stores in China were, on average, our highest traffic and our highest revenue stores in the world. We opened six stores during the December quarter, bringing us to a total of 323 stores worldwide at the quarter end, with 87 of them outside the United States.  With an average of 321 stores opened during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $12 million compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 69%.  Retail segment margin exceeded $1 billion for the first time and more than doubled from $481 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 75.7 million visitors in our stores during the quarter, compared to 50.9 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 49%.  Total company gross margin was 38.5%, which was about 250 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better commodity cost than we had planned. The remainder of the difference was due to the leverage on the higher revenue and lower other product costs, including freight, warranty and phone support.  Operating expenses were $2.47 billion and included $247 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $136 million, ahead of our guidance primarily due to the positive impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates from net asset. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, below our guidance of 25.5% due to the one-time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit from January 1, 2010. We expect our tax rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal \\'11 to be about 25.5%.  Turning to cash. Our cash, plus short-term and long-term marketable securities, totaled $59.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, compared to $51 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion. Cash flow from operations was $9.8 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year.  During the September and December quarters, we executed long-term supply agreements with three vendors through which we expect to spend a total of approximately $3.9 billion in inventory component prepayments and capital expenditures over a two-year period. We made approximately $650 million in payments under these agreements in the December quarter, and anticipate making $1.05 billion in payments in the March quarter.  As we move ahead into the March quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $22 billion, compared to $13.5 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect gross margins to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $50 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.35 billion, including about $250 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $50 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $4.90.  In closing, we\\'re extremely pleased with our record-breaking results and customer response to our products. We look forward to expanding the reach of the iPhone in the United States with the addition of Verizon, and we remain very confident in our strategy and our new product pipeline. And with that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. Also joining us for Q&A are Apple COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: I have a question for you with regard to availability of iPhones, especially with the Verizon launch. I think you mentioned that there was a backlog that you weren\\'t able to meet in the December quarter. So I don\\'t know if, Tim and Peter, if you could talk a little bit about what you\\'re doing to ensure that you have sufficient quantities of iPhones and any changes you\\'ve made to ensure more component availability?\\nTimothy Cook: Shannon, it\\'s Tim. As I mentioned on the last quarter\\'s call, we made a very bold bet, taking iPhone capacity for the September quarter with the new iPhone 4 in the lineup to 14 million. And as you may remember, we sold over 14 million in that quarter in total iPhones, so it was a fantastic quarter. And that was up from a previous number that with the 8-ish million range. We were able to step that up in this past quarter to over 16 million, as Peter said in his opening remarks. And so we were able to increase over 2 million. And we’re, obviously, have continued to work on increasing this further. But as with all good things, it takes some time to do that. Relative to Verizon, we are thrilled to offer the iPhone 4 to Verizon with 93 million customers, as well as any new customers who want an iPhone 4 on Verizon. And we\\'re going to do everything possible to get the iPhones into as many hands of those customers as possible.\\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: And then I just had one follow up, with regard to the Mac App Store, which clearly just started, though I\\'m not sure how much you\\'ll talk about it. But we\\'ve noticed your best-selling apps tend to be Apple software-based, Apple software apps. So how should we think about the Mac App Store? Any initial thoughts you have on it and initial things you\\'ve seen?\\nTimothy Cook: It\\'s just getting going, but we are thrilled to have reported over 1 million in a very short amount of time. And so we\\'re very happy with the start of it.\\nOperator: And next, we\\'ll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\\nKathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley: First question for Tim, how comfortable are you right now with the availability of iPhones and iPads? And if you still see shortages, how quickly do you think they can be addressed early this year?\\nTimothy Cook: Katy, let me take each one of those separately. On iPad, we increased dramatically last quarter. We sold 7.3 million the previous quarter, we were in the low 4s as you know. That did get us into supply-demand balance and also allowed us to expand to 46 countries, or to a total of 46 by the end of the quarter, which added 20 during the quarter. And we\\'re confident enough to add another 15 countries during the month of January that will take us over 60. And so we feel very, very good about the progress that we\\'ve made here. Relative to iPhone 4, I also feel very, very good about what we\\'ve been able to do. However, it\\'s not enough. We do still have a significant backlog. We are working around-the-clock to build more. I feel great that the demand is so high, but at this point, I\\'m not going to predict when supply and demand will meet. We believe the reaction and results from the Verizon customers will be huge, and so I don\\'t want to give a prediction right now when the supply and demand will cross.\\nKathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley: And then Tim, one of the most impressive metrics is the sequential on your growth of Asia-Pacific. Can you just talk about what\\'s driving that and what plans you have in place, going forward, to sustain that growth?\\nTimothy Cook: Yes. That\\'s a very good question. First of all, let me say that of the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China, we, several years ago, identified China as our top priority, and we put enormous energy into China. And the results of that has been absolutely staggering. To give you some numbers there and some specifics, we look at Greater China as a region. And Greater China, just for clarity, is mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The revenue from Greater China for Apple for last quarter was $2.6 billion, which was up 4x from the prior year quarter. And to further, just an exclamation point by that, we did a little over $3 billion for the entire year, fiscal year 2010. And so we\\'re very, very proud of the team and the results that we\\'ve gotten there. Korea has also been a very, very good market for us. We had an outstanding Q1 there, primarily driven by iPhone and iPads. And there are several other Asian countries doing extremely well. Japan is not in the segment that you\\'re looking out, but Japan by itself, the revenue was up 83% year-over-year. And if you\\'re familiar with the Japanese economy and the growth there, to grow 83% on the base that we\\'re doing is stunning. And so we are placing more and more resource in these areas and continue to look for expansion possibilities throughout Asia.\\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we\\'ll hear from Gene Munster.\\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: Question for Tim in terms of the long-term business planning. There\\'s been a lot of questions in terms of how far out you guys actually planned it. I was wondering if there\\'s any insight you can give us in terms of what your long-term business plan is in terms of a product road map. Obviously, you can\\'t share what that road map is. But how far will you guys go in Retail Stores and so forth? Is it a one-year plan, is it a five-year plan, is it -- any sort of insight would be helpful?\\nTimothy Cook: Well, Gene, that\\'s part of the magic of Apple. And I don\\'t want to let anybody know our magic because I don\\'t want anybody copying it. What I would tell you is that in my view, Apple is doing its best work ever, that we are all very happy with the product pipeline. And the team here has an unparalleled breadth and depth of talent and a culture of innovation that Steve has driven in the company, and excellence has become a habit. And so we feel very, very confident about the future of the company. I would also note to those people that haven\\'t thought about it is we\\'ve done outstanding in our Mac business. We\\'ve had 19 quarters straight of growing faster than the market, but we still have a relatively low share of a very large PC market despite having great momentum there. And so it would seem like there\\'s enormous opportunity still there. We have a relatively low share in the handset market. The handset market is well over 1 billion units a year, and the smartphone market is growing faster than a weed. And so there\\'s enormous opportunity here, and we have incredible momentum in that space. iPad just got started, it\\'s a new category. We sold almost 15 million through the first three quarters, and we believe the market is huge. IDC, I saw this morning, is predicting it to quadruple in two years. I don\\'t know what to predict in terms of specific numbers. However, we believe it\\'s a huge market, as we\\'ve said before. And so we\\'re in some great markets, some fast-moving markets, we have the best products we\\'ve ever done and an incredible product pipeline. We feel very, very confident.\\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: And just a follow-up for Peter, in terms of iPhones, you mentioned that if not for production constraints, you could\\'ve sold more. Is there any way to help us kind of back into how many more?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, you can\\'t run the experiment both ways, that\\'s -- the demand for iPhone has just been incredible. We could not make enough in the quarter, and we would\\'ve loved to have ended with more channel inventory than we did.\\nOperator: From Citigroup, we\\'ll hear from Richard Gardner.\\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc: I was just hoping that you could talk about what components were better than you thought in terms of price during the quarter? And then Tim, if you could give us your thoughts on the commodity environment going into the March quarter, given that flat panels are below cash costs for some providers. What are you looking for going into the March quarter, please?\\nTimothy Cook: Rich, in terms of the go-forward in March quarter and what is embedded in the guidance that Peter gave earlier is that we expect a favorable pricing environment for DRAM, where supply exceeds the demand still. Some prices for raw materials such as key metals is currently increasing due to the anticipated strengthening of the worldwide economy, and it remains to be seen whether that continues. The bulk of the other commodities from NAND Flash to batteries to HDDs to ODDs to LCDs and most other commodities are generally in a supply-demand balance. And so we would expect this group of commodities to fall in prices consistent with their historical trends. In terms of what we saw last quarter, frankly speaking, in most areas, we saw a favorability and it was a key part of us overachieving our guidance gross margin.\\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc: And actually, Tim, if I could follow up, can you talk about which component areas you\\'re making long-term commitments in on supply?\\nTimothy Cook: It\\'s something I don\\'t want to give out, Rich, because I view it as a competitive -- something I just don\\'t want our competition knowing. But let me talk about it in general and hopefully, that will suffice. From our point of view on the design side, we design components where we believe we can innovate beyond what\\'s available in the market. And the most recent example of this is the A4 chip. But with the A4 chip, we didn\\'t feel like we had to invest in the fab itself and build the fab because we felt like they were good options in the market for doing that, but not good options in terms of buying a design, and so we really focused on design. On the operational side of the house, as you probably remember, we\\'ve historically entered into certain agreements with different people to secure supply and other benefits. And the largest one in the recent past has been we signed a deal with several Flash suppliers back at the end of 2005 that totaled over $1 billion because we anticipated that Flash would become increasingly important across our entire product line and increasingly important to the industry. And so we wanted to secure supply for the company, and we think that, that was an absolutely fantastic use of Apple\\'s cash. And we constantly look for more of these. And so in the past several quarters we\\'ve identified another area and come to some recent agreements that Peter talked about in his opening comments, in that these payments consist of both prepayments and capital for process equipment and tooling. And similar to the Flash agreements, they\\'re focused in an area we feel is very strategic. And so I\\'d prefer not to go into more detail about what specific area it\\'s in, but it\\'s the same kind of thinking that led us to those deals that led us to the Flash deal.\\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we\\'ll hear from Bill Shope.\\nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Guys, in the past, your build materials for key devices has generally come down at a rate that allowed for fairly healthy gross margin expansion over time. And I\\'d say this has generally been true for iPod refreshes in the past, iPhone refreshes. Is there anything different about the iPad that we should consider going forward, that would make it difficult for margins to follow this historical pattern? And did you see some of this in the most recent quarter as well?\\nTimothy Cook: Bill, margins consist of a number different factors like which direction the commodity markets are going? Where the product is within the product life cycle, as well as the value engineering that we do and the negotiating and so forth we do. And so I don\\'t think that you can take a single product kind of out by itself and speak about it with any accuracy. And as you know, we don\\'t guide at the product level on margin. We\\'re confident with the guidance that Peter provided on gross margin in his opening comments.\\nPeter Oppenheimer: And I would ask of that, that we have always aggressively worked to lower our costs. I think we have a good track record in this regard, and we shipped a lot of iPads in the December quarter, and have very strong gross margins. So I think we were quite happy with our progress.\\nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: On the iPad side again. Now that you\\'ve had the opportunity over the past few weeks to see more detail specs and in some cases, the price points for all the countless tablet devices coming into 2011. Can you comment on how you\\'re currently dealing with competitive landscape for the iPad and how, if that\\'s changed, if at all, over the past few months?\\nTimothy Cook: Well, and if you\\'re look at what\\'s shipping today, there\\'s not much out there as you know. And generally speaking, there\\'s two kinds of groups today, that are at least on the market today. The ones that are using a Windows-based operating system are generally fairly big and heavy and expensive. They have very weak battery life, they require a keyboard or a stylus as an input device. And from our point of view and what we\\'ve seen, customers, frankly, just are not interested in them. Then you have the Android tablet, and the variety that are out shipping today, the operating system wasn\\'t really designed for a tablet. And Google has said this, and so this is not just an Apple view by any means. And so you wind up having a size of a tablet that is less than what we believe is reasonable or even one that would provide what we feel is a real tablet experience. And so basically, you wind up with kind of a scaled-up smartphone, which is a bizarre product in our view. Then you\\'ve got kind of a third group -- and so those are the two that are shipping today. And frankly speaking, it\\'s hard for me to understand if somebody does a side-by-side with an iPad, I think some enormous percentage of people are going to select an iPad there. Those are not tablets that we have any concern on. The next-generation Android tablets, which are primarily what you mentioned in terms of the CES, there\\'s nothing shipping yet, and so I don\\'t know. Generally, they lack performance specs, they lack prices, they lack timing. And so today, they\\'re vapor. We\\'ll assess them as they come out. However, we\\'re not sitting still. And we have a huge first-mover advantage. And we have an incredible user experience from iTunes to the App Store, and an enormous number of apps and a huge ecosystem. And so we\\'re very, very confident with entering into a fight with anyone.\\nOperator: From Sanford Bernstein, we\\'ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.\\nToni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research: You\\'ve said on previous earnings calls that the move to iPhone non-exclusivity in regions of the world has had no impact on your ASPs. Can you comment on whether that is it still the case today and whether we should expect any impact in the migration away from U.S. exclusivity? And related to that, there are several large carriers globally that the iPhone is still not offered in. Can you talk about some of the reasons why that isn\\'t the case? Many of them are CDMA-based. And given that you now have a CDMA-based offering, is it unreasonable to expect that we should see more CDMA carriers going forward?\\nTimothy Cook: Toni, it\\'s Tim. Relative to the ASP, I generally would not do this. And I want to be specific, that this comment isn\\'t related to the U.S. or any specific carrier or any specific region. But to specifically answer your question, I don\\'t envision the overall iPhone ASP decreasing from the December quarter that we just completed to the March quarter that we\\'re currently in. And as you know, as our long-standing practice has been, we don\\'t comment on after, after that period of time. Relative to other carriers, yes, we\\'re always looking and assessing in every country who we should be doing business with and exploring different deals and arrangements, et cetera. And so we\\'ll continue to do that. What I\\'ve said before and we have seen this in every case, literally, that we\\'ve done, is where we\\'ve moved from a exclusive carrier arrangement to a dual- or multi-carrier arrangement, our growth has changed significantly and our market share has increased. And so that doesn\\'t mean that would happen in every country nor does it mean that we\\'re just out doing that in every country. We look at each one individual because each market has its own individual characteristics and parameters and technology. On the CDMA phone, specifically, I don\\'t have any specific thing to announce today other than we\\'re truly thrilled to be working with the Verizon team. They have built quite a company and earned a great deal of respect from the customers, and some of them have waited a long time to get iPhone. And we\\'re very, very happy to give them iPhone, and any other customers that are non-Verizon customers who wish to buy an iPhone. We\\'re also very happy that we\\'ve signed a multi-year non-inclusive deal with AT&T. And so we\\'re very happy that we\\'ll have shortly a dual-carrier setup in the United States.\\nToni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research: Tim, if I could follow-up on that, given your previous comments on China and the importance of that country strategically for you and the investments that you\\'re making in stores, et cetera, can you may be use that as a case study for why you\\'re only in one carrier there? I think you\\'ve said that there are no longer any exclusive conditions that you have in place globally with any carriers. So can you talk about other either impediments or hindrances beyond technology, of which CDMA is one, that may be limiting your ability to sign important carrier agreements in potentially very important and strategic areas for the company?\\nTimothy Cook: Toni, I generally found people really want to do business with us, and their customers are very much desiring to have the iPhone. And so I don\\'t really see a lack of desire. I don\\'t want to comment about any specific country because I view any conversations that we have going confidential in nature. It is true, as you said, that we are not under a contractual exclusivity now in any country in the world. The last one was the United States. We have moved away from those. I can guarantee you that we always are looking at opportunities to grow. Of course, in the very short-term, I would also remind you that we\\'re constrained on iPhone 4, and we\\'re working around the clock to get as many of these out to our existing partners as we can.\\nOperator: We\\'ll go to Brian Blair with Wedge Partners.\\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: Can you maybe give us your updated thoughts on the Mac side and maybe specifically address the impact of iPads? With the tremendous iPad unit this quarter, the cannibalization question is going to come up. And I just want to get your latest thoughts on that, if we could?\\nTimothy Cook: That\\'s a good question. What we saw in the Mac this quarter was we grew 23% at the worldwide level, and that is compared to a market growth of only 3%. And so we grew almost 8x the market rate of growth, which is, I think, stunning. And every region outgrew the market, so it wasn\\'t just one region. Asia-Pacific led the growth with a whopping 67% year-over-year increase, and that\\'s almost 10x what market did there, to put it in context. Japan grew at 56%, which is about 6x the market, and Europe and the United States both grew in double-digits despite both markets contracting overall. And so we did significantly better than the market in every major region, and we\\'re very proud of that. Now was there any cannibalization by iPad? Honestly, I don\\'t know for sure. But yes, I think there is some cannibalization. But I also think there\\'s a halo effect. As we\\'ve seen on the Mac by the iPod some years ago, I think there is a halo effect from Apple product to Apple product. And of course, we have introduced millions of people in Asia to Apple through the iPhone. And we\\'re now introducing many more through the iPad, and I think some of those decide to buy a Mac. And so when you look at the Mac growth in Asia at 67%, and you look at the Japan growth at 56%, and you look at the U.S. and Europe growing in double-digits against shrinking markets, if this is cannibalization, it feels pretty good. The other point I would make is that if the iPad or tablets do cannibalize the PC market, keep in mind that we have low share of the PC market. And so the other guys lose a lot more, and we have a lot more to win because of that. And so honestly, cannibalization is not something that we are spending one minute on here. The iPad team are building the best iPad for the future, and the Mac teams are building the best Mac, and I can tell you that both groups believe that they can continue to grow and do great stuff, and I believe that.\\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: And that\\'s a great way to look at it. One of the things that\\'s interesting to me is I see this trend of your bringing a lot more of the functionality from the tablet side, you\\'re bringing it on to the Mac side. It was talked about earlier, the Mac App Store that\\'s now on Mac OS X. And then as we\\'re getting kind of teaser shots of Lion, it looks like the next OS is also taking even more kind of design and UI elements from the iPad side. So maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit, are these two platforms really merging into one? And is this the future of computing as you see it? Or is it just -- are you just kind of grabbing one or two aspects of tablets and bringing it into the OS X?\\nTimothy Cook: I think one of the -- part of the magic of Apple is that there\\'s not high walls between these product groups. They like each other, talk to each other, they\\'re of the same DNA, they want to build the best products in the world. And so if one has a great idea, there\\'s not a \"not invented here\" in the other group. And so one of the key learnings from the iPad was that people love instant on, they really love that. And so the MacBook Air incorporated that, and that\\'s just one simple example. But there are tons of examples throughout all of our products, where something started on one and went to a different one. And it\\'s not always in the same direction either. It could start on the phone, and then flow forward, it could start on the iPad and flow, and so on and so forth. And so just the part of the way we run the company. And I think Steve said it great when he said, \"If the Mac company were a separate company, and the iPad company were a separate company, what would the Mac company build to compete with the iPad? And I think the answer is the MacBook Air.\" And I think that\\'s a phenomenal insight, and I think a great way to look at it. And it\\'s not that the groups are competing, they are sharing and coming up with these incredible products that people really want.\\nOperator: From Bank of Montreal, we\\'ll hear from Keith Bachman.\\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Tim, do you have data that you\\'ve gathered on the Phone and/or the iPad on new to the brand. You typically talk about Macs in the stores, you\\'re getting 50% new to the brand. Do you have any data related to the newness of the brand? I would assume it\\'s substantially higher to that, but I want to hear a little bit about that. And depending on that outcome, if you talk a little bit about how you think these products, in particular, the Pad in emerging markets may help to continue drive share opportunities for you?\\nTimothy Cook: I don\\'t want to share -- do we collect it? Yes, of course, we do. The numbers for iPhone are -- there\\'s many such numbers, they\\'re now big because we\\'ve been shipping iPhones for a while. Any product that you ship for a while looks a little different at the prime end or in the early adopter cycle versus when you get to the mainstream. The iPad went through that cycle quickly, and moved to mainstream and enterprise and all the rest in record time. But nevertheless, that data needs to settle some, even before internally, we put a lot of weight in it. But the bulk of your question doesn\\'t need specific numbers. To make a point, if you look at our Asia-Pacific business, the revenue growth was 175% or so. And so this is incredible. And the size of business in Asia that we\\'ve now built is massive. To do $2.6 billion in China in three months, where just two years ago, we did less than $1 billion in the whole year, it is phenomenal, or actually for the year before. And so I think we are -- it\\'s clear that we\\'re introducing a lot of people to Apple who previously had not been introduced to the company, and I think that helps across the product line.\\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: In the U.S., I\\'m just trying to understand how you see the tablet market more broadly having greater penetration rates, say in established markets versus emerging markets. But typically, the notion is that tablets in many cases are more about consumption versus creation. And just want to hear your thoughts, not on growth rate, but on absolute unit opportunities between the established markets and the emerging markets?\\nTimothy Cook: I think that the tablet market is, the opportunity is so large, it\\'s large everywhere, honestly. I think it’s huge.\\nOperator: And we\\'ll move on to Barclays Capital, Ben Reitzes.\\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: A question for Peter, I just wanted to cash out the revenue outlook. Your sequential decline of, I guess, 17% is a little more than last year\\'s, but you have Verizon now for the iPhone. So what components, I guess, other than iPod, are expected to have to contribute to the big decline, if intuitively, maybe iPhone has some support from Verizon?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, I\\'ll answer your question in a couple of ways. First of all, we\\'re working hard to increase supply of iPhones. Tim has talked about that, but that will come over a period of time and not necessarily, overnight, as we said. In terms of the sequential guidance this year, let me start by saying we are thrilled to be giving you guidance for 63% revenue growth year-over-year, which will translate to a 50% earnings growth. So the business is performing extremely well. We\\'re shipping the best products in Apple history and customer response has been tremendous. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we increased the iPhone and the iPad channel inventory by about 775,000 units, and this will have a bit of impact on the sequential compare that you referred to. In terms of the products, for Mac, we\\'ve just reported the highest Mac sales ever, and we\\'ve outgrown the market for 19 consecutive quarters. We would expect to see a sequential unit decline, which is typical for us after the holiday season. For iPod, we would also expect to see a large sequential decline, which is also typical for us after the holiday season. For iPhone, we\\'d expect to see a significant year-over-year increase. And for iPad, this will be our first experience, going from the December to March quarter, so we\\'ll see. However, it was clear to us that the iPad was a hot holiday gift item, which fueled the 75% sequential growth that we saw in the December quarter. And given this, we would expect a sequential decline in the March quarter. So that\\'s what\\'s gone into our thinking, Ben.\\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: And then just a follow up for Tim, the last call, maybe, or one of the last calls, Steve had a lot of comments around Android and perhaps, some of its disadvantages versus your platform. Is there any other observations you\\'d like to make now that, we had a few more months, to see the market develop further and with Verizon, and even more tablet sales on the horizon, feedback you\\'re getting from developers, or anything else you\\'d like to add on the battle with Android, kind of updating Steve\\'s recent comments from last quarter?\\nTimothy Cook: Well, if you look at the iPhone portion, we had record sales on iPhone with 16.2 million units sold in the quarter. And Peter said we believe we could\\'ve sold more if we had more supply. From the market estimates that we\\'ve seen, it suggests that we grew faster than the market. Obviously, we\\'re working around the clock on increasing supply. We\\'re continuing to expand countries and carriers. And I\\'ve talked a little bit of that with Toni\\'s question. We\\'re getting enormous enterprise traction, with 88% of the Fortune 100, which is mind-blowing, I believe. 83% of the Fortune 500, 60% of the FT 100. So the enterprise traction is gaining. We have the highest customer sat [satisfaction] ratings in the industry versus Android or RIM or any -- we have the largest App Store with over 300,000 apps. We have now sold over 160 million iOS devices. And I mean, this is huge. And we fundamentally believe that our integrated approach delivers a far superior customer experience than the fragmented approach. And you can see this in a variety of ways from the fragmentation of the number of App Stores out there that people are going to pull their hair out, because they\\'re going to have a variety of updating methodologies, and a variety of payment methods, and slightly different derivatives. You can see from surveys, people are doing to see who is on the latest OS, and you\\'ll notice that the iOS is always off the charts on the percentage of people that have the latest version versus the other guys. We are launching with Verizon next month. We believe there\\'s a huge pent-up demand there, and we think that, that will help us in the U.S. And so I think I\\'d probably just repeat it, much of what he said before. But the net-net is we think that our integrated approach is much better for the end user because it takes out all the complexity for the end user instead of making the end user a systems integrator themselves. I don\\'t know about you, but I don\\'t know very many people that want to be system integrators as a consumer or somebody in the enterprise. And so I think that the more iPhones that we can get out there into people\\'s hands, the more people love them. And I think we\\'ve got a very bright future. I think the same thing about iPad. It\\'s the same set of issues at the end of the day. The differences on iPad, of course, is that we have a -- we\\'ve been running three quarters without any significant competition of any type. And I think that the customer sat ratings on the iPad are also off the charts. So I don\\'t know if any of that is new, I doubt that it is. But I think we\\'re in a very good position.\\nOperator: We\\'ll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.\\nMark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Peter, I want to see if you can give us a little more insight on the iPad gross margins going forward. Just given Tim\\'s comments earlier about the bounty of underachievers out there, at least, nearly going, should we assume then that Apple can really improve the future set with the next generation and kind of hold pricing stable?\\nPeter Oppenheimer: I\\'m sorry, Mark, that\\'s not a question I can answer. We don\\'t talk about future products. But I can tell you that in terms of what we\\'re shipping today, we\\'re always aggressively working to lower our costs. And I think we have a good track record in doing so, and our gross margins were stronger than we thought for the December quarter. And I\\'ve provided guidance for the March quarter at 38.5%. And we feel very, very good about the performance of our products and our cost of products.\\nMark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then my follow-up, Tim, I apologize if this question has been asked, I fell off for a moment, I want to come back to the MacBook Air. Just given the initial success here and momentum, can you give us any sort of insight in terms of how you\\'re looking at that platform now? Is it kind of a premium tablet? Is this kind of more of a notebook still? I trying to get a sense of just kind of a one-two punch in terms of the iPad, with the MacBook Air, kind of giving you a kind of a double coverage, if you will, in both notebooks and tablets?\\nTimothy Cook: The way that we look at it is it\\'s the Mac of the future shipping today, and it was a phenomenal part of our growth on the Mac last quarter. It has gotten off to a unbelievable start. The customers love it. They love the precision of it, they love the thinness, the weight, the instant on and the list is long, I think. And so we\\'re really happy with how it\\'s doing out of the starting blocks. And as you know, we\\'ve only been shipping it for less than 90 days, and so we\\'ve just gotten going.\\nOperator: We\\'ll go to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.\\nJason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: There\\'s been a lot of talk about this consumerization of enterprise technology, and obviously, it\\'s being driven by folks bringing their iPhones and iPads to work. I know you said it\\'s some big share gains within your statistics. But I was curious if you think there still are some barriers around maybe developer training at the corporate level or security or things that just sort of naturally need to get worked through before you start to see those penetration numbers even increase further or start to see a wider swathe of employees use iPhones and iPads in business?\\nTimothy Cook: I think that the consumerization that you speak of, of the enterprise, is one of the megatrends that are occurring. I think the most forward-looking CIOs are coming to the realization that the productivity of the person, the creativity of the employees is materially more important than everyone using the same thing. And the ability to write apps in a simple and straightforward manner for the iPhone or the iPad through the SDK is an incredible thing. And you can wind up, literally, running your whole business off of an iPad or an iPhone. And so I think the list of ideas and places that people can go there are -- were unimaginable just a few months ago. And so I see an enormous potential there. The numbers are already incredible. And think about this, the iPad started shipping in April, and we\\'re already up to 80% of the largest companies deploying or piloting the product. This is unheard of, at least, in my dealings with the enterprise over the years. Generally, enterprise is much slower and much more cautious and uses things that have been in the market for a long time. And I think to everyone\\'s credit, they\\'ve seen the value of this from a productivity and creativity point of view, and they\\'re really moving fast. And so I think we\\'re just scratching the surface right now. In terms of inhibitors, the iPad has a huge advantage because as you probably remember, as we went to various different iOS releases, we always put in a huge chunk of enterprise features. And so this isn\\'t something that we just started focusing on. We started focusing on this before we shipped the first phone. And with the synergy that exists with the iOS between the different products, other products get the advantage of it, not just the product that it ships on initially. And so I think there\\'s a huge play here for us.\\nNancy Paxton: A replay of today\\'s call will be available for two weeks, as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.
